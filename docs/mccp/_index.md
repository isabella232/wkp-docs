## Multi-cluster control plane

The multi-cluster control plane (MCCP) provides ops teams with an easy way to assess the health of multiple clusters in a single place. It shows cluster information such as Kubernetes version and number of nodes and provides details about the GitOps operations on those clusters, such as Git repositories and recent commits. Additionally, it aggregates Prometheus alerts and also presents a stream of Kubernetes events from all the clusters to assist with troubleshooting.
